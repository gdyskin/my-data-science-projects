# Study of the technological process of gold refining

Goal: Prediction of gold concentration during ore refining 

Description: A machine learning model is created for an industrial company that develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial enterprises. The model is to predict the gold recovery rate from gold ore based on data with mining and refining parameters. The model will help optimize production to avoid creating a company with unprofitable characteristics.

Data: Datasets with data from different stages of the technological process of gold refining from ore.

Data Description: Data description provided in the project notebook

Libraries: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Tags: data analysis, regression, custom metrics
